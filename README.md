# LeetCode-problem-202
To determine if a number is happy, I used an iterative approach with a cycle-detection technique, employing a HashSet to store previously seen numbers. The algorithm repeatedly replaces the number with the sum of the squares of its digits. If the number becomes 1, it is happy; otherwise, if it loops endlessly and revisits a number in the set, it indicates a cycle, making the number unhappy. This ensures efficiency and prevents infinite loops. The getSumOfSquares method handles digit-wise computations, while the main method tracks the process and detects cycles.
